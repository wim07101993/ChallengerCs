# ChallengerCs

ChallengerCs challenges you to write some algorithms in C#. The challenge just
has one rule: **it must work**. To verify whether it works, unit tests and 
benchmarks are written, ready to test.

To keep comparisons fair, there are different categories to enter in:

- `.Net`
- `Linq`
- Performance
- Obfuscation / Source length

## Challenge categories

### `.Net`

The `.Net` challenge is the least objective challenge. The goal here is to
write code that is as clean and idiomatic as possible according to the `.Net`
standards. What this exactly means is probably depends on the viewer. For the
challenges sake, I am the referee here. However, I might be persuaded with
compelling arguments (but my friends say I am quit stubborn so...).

### `Linq`

The `Linq` challenge is much alike the `.Net` challenge in the way that it
is not completely objective. The goal here is to try write code 'only' with
`Linq` statements. This might not possible for everything but try and prove
me otherwise.

### Performance

The performance challenge is quite obvious I think. Try to write code that
has the best performance. The main-goal is execution time but memory is also
something to keep in mind.

### Obfuscation / Source length

This one might be close to the performance challenge but here short and 
obfuscated source code is the goal. To show others what happens it is
preferable to add a private non obfuscated method or comments explaining 
the flow.

## How participate

### Solve challenges

1. Create a separate branch under `challenge-solutions` (eg: 
  `challenge-solutions\wim07101993`)
2. Implement the functionality as you think best.
3. Test code.
4. Create a pull request.

The 'best' code will be used in the master branch.

## Be a judge

Help me judge which code is best in it's category.

To judge, just comment on commits/pull requests or issues. Again here is a
general rule: Keep it nice!. Keep in mind that this is a fun project and
everyone participating is doing this to relax and have fun. Next to that 
some participants might be less experienced than you and not have the same
insights yet or have a different point of view.

Bottom line: Respect the participants and be nice to each other!. 

(and when there is doubt: I am always right üòÅ)

## Help with development

This repo contains more than just an interface that should be implemented.
There are application, unit test and benchmark projects to test the 
implementations.

Whoever wants can also help improving these in the `development` and feature
branches.

## Issues

If you have issues with anything, just post an issue.
